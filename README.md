# Multisig Wallet Example

 I built this project in order to practice my skills in solidity. 
 The goal is that you can deploy the contract to your local truffle blockchain emulator and do transactions between the truffle demo accounts.

You can 

 * add multiple owners 
 * decide how many approvals are necessary to confirm a transaction
 * approve or reject transactions
 
Frontend is still a work in Progress.
